Hi, my name is Stefan and I am a student at the University of Edinburgh. Soon I'll be getting my BEng in Software Engineering (hopefully :).

I've been working with Ruby on Rails for a while and I find it pretty cool.


You can see my resume/cv on [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/stefanadamov/).
