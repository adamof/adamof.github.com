A month ago I had the chance to go to RailsConf 2014 in Chicago, thanks to [HouseTrip](http://housetrip.com). All I can say is that it was a truly awesome experience. I was able to see some of the giants in the Rails community live and even chat with them (even just for a [Gorbypuff sticker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1Q3q151C3T3f2T1J0o0k/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-22%20at%207.55.25%20PM.png)
)).

Anyway, long story short - I managed to jot down some notes about the talks. You can see them [here](https://github.com/adamof/railsconf_2014). This repository also includes notes from my colleague [Pedro](https://github.com/pedrocunha).
