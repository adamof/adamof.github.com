### About team Batkan and our baby - [Flyscape](http://koshov.github.com/SmartData/)
----------------------------------
*This is my first blog post so please bear with me*

A bit about the [hackathon](http://data.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilwhack/) - it is organised by the School of Informatics at University of Edinburgh as part of the Innovative Learning Week (a week, during which there are not lectures and no assignments, a week that you are supposed to spend learning new stuff and getting industrial experience). The main focus of the hackathon was using open data sets and some of the sponsors(in terms of data) were: [Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.net), The City of Edinburgh Council, OpenInnovation and the School of Informatics itself. The length was a bit longer than the usual- it was a Monday to Friday event, filled with a lot of unhealthy snacks.

It was a really pleasant experience mainly because of my team mates, all of them were driven and smart! We had decided we wanted to use the data provided by Skyscanner about flights and prices, so we came up with the idea about a trip planner with a map that people can use to select location they want to visit (Rome, Paris, London for example) and we also wanted to include some recommendations about weather and music festivals. Our system would then find the cheapest way to visit all of the destinations and fly back to the origin. This was about flying cheap so we decided we are going to throw [couchsurfing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing) hosts in the package.

During the hackathon we worked really well and everyone had a well-defined task:

* Yordan - the algorithm to find the cheapest route
* Stefan Subev - worked on fetching the flights from the Skyscanner API
* Georgi - worked on the identity and design of the web app
* Nikolay - worked on the scrapers that gathered information about couchsurfing locations, music festivals and weather data
* me - I was gluing things together with Django and helping other people (most of the time that was the Mac guys, cause they had problems with the Postgres setup)

This is what came out:

We ended up winning in the "Travel and Leisure" category and we were given some neat prizes by Skyscanner.
