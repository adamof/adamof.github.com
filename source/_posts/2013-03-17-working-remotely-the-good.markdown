> Don't you just wish you could work from home in your pajamas?

I will try to describe what telecommuting is about and what pros and cons it has. While I certainly think that remote working is a great option, some precaution must be taken to make sure that the employee is experienced enough to actually benefit from it. Furthermore, success depends equally on the employee, the management and the tools used. I will also share a bit of my humble experience in the area of remote work to try and compare the in-office environment to a remote one.

### Background
#### What is telecommuting?
Telecommuting is a type of work arrangement between an employer and an employee that allows the employee to work from outside the office. Often the preferred location for working is the home, but in recent times, the coffee shops and [co-working spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking) tend to attract the nowadays 'nomads'. There are a lot of flavors to the word "telecommuting". In this article I will discuss particularly the professionals developing software from a remote location, at least three days a week. It is not rare that whole teams are spread throughout the globe, which was the case with my first job.

#### Who does it?
I do it and my favorite [Github](http://github.com) does it! Only a [third](https://twitter.com/holman/status/312958138494103553) of their staff is at the San Francisco headquarters. According to statistics from the [US Bureau of Labour](http://www.bls.gov/bls/proghome.htm#employment) for 2011, there are about 3 million people in the US who telecommute at least three days a week.

### The good
Pros of telecommuting in personal aspect and in organisational aspect.

**Personal**

* **no commuting** - no more worrying about the rush hours
* **flexible hours** - Not a morning person? That's fine, you can work in the evenings.
* **work/life balance** - this one can be tricky, but in general it is up to you how much you work
* **comfort** - you are at home in your PJs and slippers
* **productivity** - no need for office smalltalk, and you are on your own chords
* **can work on an exciting project** - you can get to work on a project that is bleeding edge no matter where you're based
* **home costs** - you can work from the province and enjoy the fresh air, while working on that Big Data crunching project

**Organisational**

* **lower office costs** - the business headquarters can be smaller, since they don't have to accommodate that many people on a day-to-day basis.
* Companies are able to find and secure talent worldwide rather than limiting themselves to what is available locally. 
* Staff can be compensated at rates that are appropriate for their location rather than what is required at the company headquarters.

### The bad
Cons of telecommuting in personal aspect and in organisational aspect.

**Personal**

* **discipline** - you have to take work seriously, which is hard without having a forced working hours
* **work/life balance** - it is easy to become a workaholic, if you *really* love what you do
* **isolation** - remote work takes it's toll even on introverts, you are home or somewhere else and the casual chats with co-workers are not as easy
* **distractions** - the office distractions are replaced with home chores and family distractions
* **communication** - you are missing out on the casual hallway chats, when some decisions are made

**Organisational**

* Management must embrace a management by requirements and deadlines style rather than by walking around and seeing staff work.
* Management must be willing to go to the effort to routinely reach out to remote employees to understand what they are doing and if there are problems that need to be addressed.
* Management must be willing to use audio and video conferencing as well as instant messaging and Email to keep connected with remote staff. This also means that the company's collaborative application licensing, processing and storage costs might be higher.
* Networking and network security costs can be higher.

### And you
Well I don't know about you, but I can tell you a bit about my experience and what I've been told by more senior engineers with remote development experience. Keep in mind that these are my personal opinions and conclusions drawn from my own experience. I believe that only senior developers can really benefit from a remote working environment. Here I will discuss how remote development feels in different levels of expertise.

#### Junior positions
My first real software engineering job was a **remote** one and all the communication was conducted through email, skype and chats. It was the first time I was working with a specific web development framework and I had a lot of questions about the platform and the good practices and even though my managers were pretty good with responding in time, I was still baffled most of the time. I had to do a lot of reading on my own and I was never sure I am doing the right thing.


To compare that to an **office** environment I will give an example about my next job at another company doing web development as well. I was amazed how much more you learn at the office. Every day I went to work I was excited about it, because I would learn a few mind-blowing tricks that day. My mentor was within arm reach and he'd be happy to explain.

#### Not-so-junior positions
Due to relocation, I started working remotely again after working at the office for about five months. Even though I felt some of the drawbacks like isolation and distraction, this time it was a lot easier, I had experience with the development cycle, I knew the framework and I was confident enough to work on my own. But yet the scales aren't tilted to the remote work, they are more like balanced, meaning that I wouldn't consider the option for remote work an important aspect when applying for a job (except for foreign countries, where relocation is a problem).

#### Senior positions
From talking to more senior developers that have done both in-office and remote work and some blogposts I have stumbled upon on the internet, the overall opinion is that telecommuting can be actually more productive than working at the office. For them the great benefit comes from the ability to minimize interruptions and focus on what they are doing. They wouldn't be interrupted by someone tapping them on the shoulder to ask how to do something. They don't have to go through the obligatory small-talk with people in the hallways. And lastly, they are experienced enough to be able to carry a task from beginning to end.

### All in all
Working whenever and wherever you want is great, but with great power comes great responsibility. The main dangers are difficult communication, distractions and isolation, but if the person is experienced and disciplined enough they can be overcome with the help of the management team.
